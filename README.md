# Tic-Tac-Toe React App

This repository contains the code for a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React.

## Features

- Interactive game board with a 3x3 grid
- Players can take turns to place their symbols (X or O) on the board
- The game checks for a winner after each move and displays the winner or current player's turn

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Open a terminal in the project directory root and run `npx live-server` to run the app.

## Usage

1. Two players take turns to place their symbols (Player X starts with the 'X' symbol, Player O uses the 'O' symbol) on the game board.
2. The game checks for a winner after each move, and if a player wins, the message "Winner is Player X" or "Winner is Player O" will be displayed, depending on the winner.
3. If no winner is found, the message "No Winner Yet" is displayed and the game continues until a player wins or the board is full.
